# Wiki + TypeDoc Example

This project exists a template for automating pushing changes to the project
wiki when a PR that modifies the /wiki folder is merged, or when the classes
and functions in /src are modified.

/src contains some simple data structures which have been documented with
TSDoc comments. When changes to these files are merged, TypeDoc will
generate markdown files which will be included in the project wiki.
